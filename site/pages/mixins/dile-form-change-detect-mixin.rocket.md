# DileFormChangeDetectMixin

This mixin detects changes in a form and emmit a ```dile-form-changed``` event when it occurs.

To detect changes the form elements should emmit a ```element-changed``` event. for this reason, this mixins only works with custom elements that have this custom event implemented.

> You could use the [DileEmmitChangeMixin](/mixins/dile-emmit-change-mixin) to send the ```element-changed``` custom event easily.

Also, for this mixin do its work depends on the [DileFormMixin](/mixins/dile-form-mixin), so you need to implement both mixins.

## Installation

npm i @dile/dile-form-mixin
